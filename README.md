# Yellow restaurant

# Educational team project

This is the front-end of a food delivery app created in React. We get data from a meal API and also from the backend API created in Spring Boot. (https://github.com/AndreeaGrosu23/Restaurant.git). The users can register, login and logout, browse products by category. Items can be added to a favorites list, user profile can be updated and also items can be added to a shopping cart.
